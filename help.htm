    The <b>Campus Place Finder</b> application helps employees, students, or
    visitors locate a person or a place within a campus, office building, military
    base or university. This application is typically used by employees, students or
    visitors on a campus.<br>
    <br>
    To locate a person, select the Find Person radio button then simply enter the
    person's first name, last name or full name in the search box. Or to locate a
    place, select the Find Place radio button then simply enter the office or
    conference room number in the search box. The person's office or room of
    interest will then be highlighted on the map and relevant information about the
    space will be presented to you.
