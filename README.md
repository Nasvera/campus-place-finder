Campus Place Finder is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a JavaScript application that allows employees and visitors to locate people and places on a campus or in a single building. This application is typically used by employees or university students to locate an office or conference room in a building, but can also be used by visitors to locate an individual employee they are visiting.
